# terraform-getting-started

Walking through the [getting started guide](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html) for terraform.

Also walking through other examples of terraform and seeing if I can replicate some patterns (like externalizing vars into a separate file) as I go.

Running this using terraform requires a _*.auto.tfvars_ file that details your aws credentials and the id of the Amazon Machine Image (ami_id) that you want to use.
This file should be gitignored.
